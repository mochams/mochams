Welcome to my GitHub space. I build things that work by turning complex problems into simple, maintainable code.

"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication" - Leonardo da Vinci

I live by KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) because the best code is the one you don't have to explain... much. 😉

### `💪 Skills`

```
🔐 Building secure, scalable, and fault-tolerant systems. If it crashes, it wasn't my code.
🛠️ Backend wizardry with Python, Erlang, and PostgreSQL—because real developers love data.
☁️ Infrastructure taming: Kubernetes, Terraform, Ansible...basically, Infrastructure as Code.
🧪 QA craftsmanship: TDD, BDD, and breaking things so users don't have to.
🔥 Frontend Sorcery with Svelte and SvelteKit.
🧠 AI engineering in software applications, teaching machines to do my bidding.
```

### `📊 Open source projects`

- **psqache** - Fast python/asyncio cache client using PostgreSQL.
- **codetrail** - Version control system inspired by Git. Come fight me!

Remember: In a world of complex solutions, be the one who finds the simple path. 🤓
